##  Case Study #2: Business Intelligence Dashboard (Power BI)

### **Project Overview**

The objective was to transform raw data into a set of actionable visualizations to enable informed decision-making and performance monitoring.

###  **Analysis and Key Features**

The Power BI dashboard was designed to provide insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:

* **Performance Measurement:** Visualizing key metrics like sales trends, inventory levels, or cost structures.
* **Data Aggregation:** Consolidating complex operational data into a single, user-friendly interface.
* **Interactive Filtering:** Allowing users to filter data by dimension (e.g., time, product, region) for deeper analysis and root cause investigation.

### **Technologies Used**
